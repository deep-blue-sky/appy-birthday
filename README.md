## Ideas for a Deep Blue Sky Frontend Developer task

##### what are we seeking from a frontend developer && how best can we discover this from a task?

### We would like to see examples of...

- hand written HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- ability to effectively reuse existing CSS classes

- simple and effectively use of PHP (e.g. loop, arrays, variables, etc)

- CSS animations/transitions

- JavaScript (perhaps to fire events... or other creative uses)

### This task?

- download (or even better, fork) this repo and add markup, styles and JS to finish turning the PSD into a one page app
